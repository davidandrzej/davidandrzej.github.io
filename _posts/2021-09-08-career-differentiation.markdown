Software engineers (like anyone) often want a structured framework for
thinking about career progression and growth. Many companies provide
this in the form of a
[career ladder](https://www.levels.fyi/blog/what-are-career-levels-ladders.html),
and there are a wide variety of resources for learning more about
developing skills and achieving milestones corresponding to different
levels of the ladder. The simplicity of this approach can
under-emphasize more _strategic_ dimensions of personal
development. For example, how can you cultivate some specialization,
depth, or versatility that distinguishes you from a
[replacement-level](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Value_over_replacement_player)
[Google L5](https://www.levels.fyi/?compare=Google,Facebook,Microsoft&track=Software%20Engineer)?
We can consider other non-ladder frameworks that place more emphasis
on these aspects by viewing career development through the lens of
startups, investing, or product development.

## Context

This post is a
["Don't Repeat Yourself" (DRY)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Don%27t_repeat_yourself)
attempt to capture links and other resources on these topics that I've
by now shared with people individually
[more than three times](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rule_of_three_(computer_programming)). My
intention here is to assemble and briefly describe a collection of
ideas from which the reader can take or leave what they
like. Everyone's personal situations and trade-offs vary considerably,
and even a specific individual's context, objectives, and constraints
will be dynamic over time - _caveat lector_!

## Get enough sleep, exercise, eat your vegetables

Certain guidance is well-worn or cliché for good reason (ie, it is
basically true): invest in your communication skills, follow through
on your commitments, seek out learning opportunities, develop your
craft, and try to understand the broader context. There is no shortage
of excellent books and articles covering these topics. But once you
are already investing in these foundations, what's next?

## Beyond the ladder

As mentioned earlier, many tech companies have some version of a
career ladder: a linear (vertical, even!) progression of increasing
impact, expertise, and responsibility. More sophisticated versions may
strain the metaphor by forking into different tracks of growth such as
technical leadership or people management. These ladders are a popular
tool for good reasons, as they encapsulate a useful consensus bundle
of information, structure, and shared vocabulary.

However, there is room in the toolkit for more than one
tool. Alternatively we might think of a career as a sequential process
of making investments of effort and attention into uncertain endeavors
over time. Instead of a diligent climber making cumulative progress up
a ladder, imagine a calculating gambler (or investor, if you like),
continuously allocating a scarce portfolio of skills, time, and other
capital to solving problems, identifying and evaluating opportunities,
and gathering additional information.  Variations on this theme
include thinking of a career as a startup or product, spending capital
to carve out a lucrative niche. Viewed from this perspective, tidy
questions about the next rung of the ladder are replaced by more
open-ended questions around differentiation and decision-making under
limited information or uncertainty.

### Differentiation

> "...don’t enter the rat race unless you’re the fastest rat!" -Erik Torenberg, ["Build Personal Moats"](https://eriktorenberg.substack.com/p/build-personal-moats)

The writings of business theorist
[Michael Porter](https://www.amazon.com/Understanding-Michael-Porter-Essential-Competition/dp/1422160599)
contain strong warnings against companies simply trying to be "the
best," as any gains will inevitably be competed away by equally
determined and capable competitors. The opposite of the naive "battle
to be the best" is the careful formulation and execution of a
well-chosen strategy that charts a course towards a _unique and
defensible_ position in the marketplace. One example from the book is
that IKEA doesn't necessarily make the world's best furniture in some
absolute sense, but they have a very attractive value proposition for
a particular customer segment, and their entire business commits
wholly to going after this market via an interlocking set of
difficult-to-replicate trade-offs.

Analogously, a career plan premised on being the smartest, most
talented, or hardest working is, by definition, a dicey proposition
for all but a few individuals. The same pitfalls also apply to highly
competitive tournaments such as exclusive university admissions or
selective employers. Indeed, the odds become even more dire if you
believe that the internet has created a global marketplace for talent,
or that advances in technology are tending to create "winner take all"
outcomes. The thoughtful development of some _rare and valuable_ skill
(or combination of skills) is one way to, at least somewhat, sidestep
the costly and unwinnable "battle to be the best (employee)." Some
links to thought-provoking writing on this topic are below, and many
of these articles themselves have links to further reading materials:

### Uncertainty

![Uncertainty](/assets/img/uncertainty.png){:class="img-responsive" :height="50%" width="50%" : .center-image }

One challenge around trying to build some differentiated personal
value proposition is that, by definition, there must be some "moat"
preventing others from doing so, or doing it as effectively as you
can.  Going again to the startup analogy, a trio of fascinating blog
posts (links below) from Jerry Neumann propose that startups
fundamentally take on the risk of attacking _uncertain_ opportunities,
and that this uncertainty acts as a _temporary_ moat keeping
competitors from entering. During this window of time, the startup is
in a race to exploit that buffer to build some other, more durable
advantage(s) before the opportunity is sufficiently de-risked in the
eyes of other better-resourced entrants. Jumping back to personal
skillsets, an example of this could be becoming an expert in some
emerging but as yet unproven technology, process, or domain.

This approach requires you to take on some risk that your bet
_doesn't_ pay off (eg, the tech you chose doesn't take off). If it
were a sure thing, everyone would already be piling into it and it
would be difficult to stand out from the crowd. Hopefully you have
some insider information or domain expertise to formulate a better
assessment of the odds than the general public, but there will still
be an element of uncertainty to be evaluated and managed. Joining an
early-stage startup can also be interpreted in this way. You are quite
definitely placing a bet where the potential payoffs include both
direct financial rewards as well as exposure to different kinds of
growth and learning opportunities than you might get elsewhere.

Therefore, to effectively execute on your career strategy, it would be
helpful to get comfortable incorporating the unknown and the uncertain
into your decision processes. Below are some interesting links on this
theme, many of which are unsurprisingly concerned with the problem
setting of financial investment:

### Putting it all together: what's your edge?

If you find any of the above even remotely compelling, it could be a
worthwhile exercise to try and explicitly work through an inventory of
your worldview, skills, interests, and goals in these terms: how are
you (or could you be) _uniquely well-positioned_ to create exceptional
value or solve important problems?

- What is your existing (or desired) "career moat"? 
- What has to happen for you to get there? 
- What hypotheses or predictions about the broader world would have to
  be true in order for this bet to pay off - ie, where is there
  uncertainty?
- What are the next intermediate checkpoints along the way?

Put another way, if you were positioning yourself in a job interview:
what is your "edge" or "secret weapon"?  Remember, all the candidates
will (at least claim to) be proactive problem-solvers with
cutting-edge technical skills, excellent collaboration habits, and a
strong track record! At least once in a while, you may want to look
"sideways" from the ladder and try to think about things a bit
differently.
