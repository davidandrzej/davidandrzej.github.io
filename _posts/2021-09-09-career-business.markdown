Following on a
[previously posted collection of links](http://blog.david-andrzejewski.com/career-differentiation.html),
here is another collection of resources focused on more
organization-oriented topics. These are not exhaustive, and indeed
some of these resources likely contradict each other outright. As in
previous post, the reader is encouraged to take what they find
suitable and leave the rest.

## Context

Most likely, a good deal of your professional work will occur in the
context of collaboration with other individuals acting in some
coordinated way to achieve higher-level goals. While your individual
efforts will make a crucial contribution to the outcome, the
effectiveness of _how_ you and others _work together_ will also be
hugely important. Given this, it is worth giving some dedicated
thought to the structure and dynamics of teams, organizations
(especially businesses), and management. 

### WHAT: product development

Software engineering often supports the development of products or
services that solve (either internal or external) customer
problems. Questions about _what exactly_ the team should build are
important, and it is useful to acquire some familiarity with
frameworks and tools people use to grapple with them:

- [The Lean Product Playbook](https://www.amazon.com/Lean-Product-Playbook-Innovate-Products-ebook/dp/B00SZ638C8/) - Dan Olsen
- [What Customers Want](https://www.amazon.com/What-Customers-Want-Outcome-Driven-Breakthrough/dp/0071408673) - Anthony Ulwick

### HOW: teams, management, and organizations

How do people, teams, and organizations align and coordinate their
efforts most effectively? Tough question, but here are some books
about it.

*Not necessarily software-specific:*
- [High Output Management](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B015VACHOK/) - Andrew Grove
- [High Growth Handbook](https://www.amazon.com/High-Growth-Handbook-Elad-Gil/dp/1732265100/) - Elad Gil
- [Principles](https://www.principles.com/) - Ray Dalio

*At least kind of software-specific:*
- [The Principles of Product Development Flow](https://www.amazon.com/Principles-Product-Development-Flow-Generation/dp/1935401009) - Donald Reinertsen
- [Manager's Path](https://www.amazon.com/Managers-Path-Leaders-Navigating-Growth/dp/1491973897) - Camille Fournier
- [An Elegant Puzzle](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07QYCHJ7V/) - Will Larson
- [Accelerate: The Science of Lean Software and DevOps](https://itrevolution.com/accelerate-book/) - Nicole Forsgren, PhD, Jez Humble, and Gene Kim

### WHY: business structure and strategy

Zooming even further out than "What/Product" questions, we can
consider why the business even exists, how it is organized, and why it
does what it does:

- [The Nature of the Firm](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/j.1468-0335.1937.tb00002.x) - Ronald Coase
- [7 Powers](https://www.amazon.com/7-Powers-Foundations-Business-Strategy/dp/0998116319) - Hamilton Helmer
- [Understanding Michael Porter](https://www.amazon.com/Understanding-Michael-Porter-Essential-Competition/dp/1422160599) - Joan Magretta 

### WILD CARD: Harrison Metal

[Harrison Metal](https://www.harrisonmetal.com/) is an interesting
organization, see their website for details. Among other things, they
offer a library of free short instructional videos on a (very) wide
range of startup and business topics and tactics. A few in particular
that I have often forwarded to people are below:

- [Thank you, Barbara Minto](https://www.harrisonmetal.com/library/storytelling-amp-presenting-1-thank-you-barbara-minto)
- [Sense-Making Cartoons](https://www.harrisonmetal.com/library/sense-making-cartoons)
- [Drake's Equation](https://www.harrisonmetal.com/library/drake-s-equation)
- [Thank you, Robert McKee](https://www.harrisonmetal.com/library/storytelling-amp-presenting-2-thank-you-robert-mckee)

### Optional: tangentially relevant historical nonfiction

It can also be illuminating to take a deeper dive on some specific
historical (up to and including very recent history) examples of
teams, organizations, and projects.

- [The Idea Factory](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B005GSZIWG) - Jon Gertner
- [The Making of the Atomic Bomb](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00E2RG5GA) - Richard Rhodes
- [Working in Public: The Making and Maintenance of Open Source Software](https://www.amazon.com/dp/0578675862/) - Nadia Eghbal
